# Hermes Desktop Capability Parity and Visibility

Status: **Phase 1 accepted; functional parity workstream open for live-data review**

This audit compares runtime-detected installed Hermes metadata, live installed Hermes Agent management/runtime surfaces, a dated upstream `NousResearch/hermes-agent` audit, Cabinet `feat/hermes-functional-parity`, and Cabinet-native equivalents. Installed Hermes determines what can work now. Upstream-only functionality is never counted as current installed support.

The persisted upstream audit was captured at `2026-07-19T21:06:53Z` from commit `0d2ad3993eb91c486854bc71e2721b747ab1d0f4`. The installed backend was Hermes Agent `0.18.2` at `594308d4bbe95548c9fe418bb10c449099426f93`, 328 commits behind that upstream point. Cabinet labels the audit stale when the detected installed version or commit changes, or when the audit ages beyond seven days. Hermes Desktop is detected as `0.17.0`; its source commit is shown as unknown because the installed bundle does not expose a stable source identifier.

## Parity states

- `first_class`: the Cabinet registry records a fully exposed and governed surface. Runtime failure can degrade health and evidence credit, but cannot erase the implemented surface.
- `mapped`: Cabinet has a different but equivalent surface.
- `visible_read_only`: current status and useful details are visible, but management remains elsewhere or is intentionally withheld.
- `diagnostic_only`: available through an explicit diagnostic escape path.
- `unsupported`: the installed Hermes version does not expose a stable interface.
- `missing`: Hermes supports it but the Cabinet registry explicitly records no usable surface.

## Functional parity dimensions

Parity is reported as four independent dimensions so discoverability cannot disguise missing live data or controls. The percentages below are calculated from all 48 inventoried capabilities; unsupported and inconvenient capabilities are not omitted.

These are implementation-branch values, not a closure claim. The Control Center calculates and displays the same dimensions from the full registry at runtime.

## Functional implementation evidence

The Phase 1 matrix above remains the complete inventory. Runtime projection independently reports health, evidence, and credit without rewriting the registry-owned Cabinet surface state.

| Module | Live interface | Current delivery | Safety and remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agents and subagents | `/api/plugins/kanban/workers/active` and board runs | Active/recent workers, parent session/run, task, profile distinction, state, current action, result, and error | Governed termination of one specifically identified active Kanban run is implemented behind fresh live authority, exact typed confirmation, stale-state protection, and idempotent reconciliation. No live mutation has yet been performed. |
| Messaging | `/api/messaging/platforms` | Platform, configured/connected state, destination identity, incoming trigger state, outbound permission, last success, and failure | Test/send/setup remain disabled; no credential values reach the response. |
| Notifications | Cabinet browser/in-app notification surface | Six requested event preferences, completion sound preference, browser permission status, and in-app test | This is `mapped`, not a claim that Cabinet manages every Hermes Desktop preference. It never prompts for permission automatically. |
| Voice | `/api/audio/transcribe` and `/api/audio/speak` plus browser Permissions API | Unprobed server interfaces remain unknown; browser permission is observed without prompting | Recording and playback require Jeremy's explicit browser permission and live review. No permission prompt was triggered during implementation. |
| Artifacts | `/api/files` | Global typed file index with size, timestamp, and available associations | Safe preview/reveal/download and richer run/session association remain missing. |
| Memory / Starmap | `/api/learning/graph` | Exact nodes, edges, counts, source, age, profile, and honest empty state | A historical `operator-os` runtime record captured at `2026-07-19T21:06:53Z` reported 39 nodes and 38 edges. The Phase 2A.2 acceptance fixture for `operator-os`, captured at `2026-07-19T22:15:00.000Z`, is explicitly empty. Neither observation is treated as a profile-independent claim, and Cabinet does not fabricate relationships. Search/inspect and confirmed delete/archive remain missing. |
| Sessions / archives | `/api/sessions` | Searchable canonical session rows with date, profile, status, archive/pin fields, model, and preview | Export, restore, and confirmed delete remain missing. Cabinet opens the canonical session surface rather than inventing a resume mutation. |
| Providers, models, gateway | `/api/auth/providers`, `/api/model/info`, `/api/model/options`, live status | Redacted provider authentication state, model availability/current model, gateway mode/state, and last connection | Account setup, model changes, and gateway restart/reconnect remain owner-gated and are not enabled here. |
| Browser / OpenCLI | bounded `opencli doctor` plus local read-only acceptance | Version, safe binary path, daemon/extension/profile connectivity, capability support, last diagnostic, and explicit recheck | Repair/reconnect remains disabled pending a reviewed governed action. No duplicate Hermes-native OpenCLI skill is installed. |

### Exact missing capabilities

- Operator: safe artifact open/reveal/download; messaging repair/test; voice recording/transcription/playback after permission; memory search/inspect; archive restore/export/delete; confirmed OpenCLI repair/reconnect.
- Management: governed provider/account setup, model/default/profile changes, gateway lifecycle, plugin/MCP/skill administration, notification-center history, update controls, and safe bounded maintenance workflows.
- Developer: live typed projections for terminal, files, source-control review, projects, worktrees, raw configuration/logs, keybindings, session tabs/pinning, layout, and low-level gateway diagnostics. These remain discoverable but earn no Live Visibility, Governed Management, or Live-Proven credit yet.
- Installed-version unsupported: Billing remains `unsupported`; a future upstream feature is not counted as installed parity.

### Owner action queue

1. Grant microphone permission and review live record, transcription, playback, and failure behavior.
2. Approve any provider OAuth or account interaction before it is tested.
3. Approve model/default/profile changes before mutation testing.
4. Approve gateway or production-process restart/reconnect tests.
5. Approve plugin, skill, or MCP installation/change tests.
6. Review live session archive/export/restore behavior before destructive delete is added.
7. Review a governed OpenCLI repair/reconnect contract before that control is enabled.

## Source evidence

- Installed Desktop metadata: `/Applications/Hermes.app/Contents/Info.plist` and `install-stamp.json`.
- Installed Desktop source commit: unavailable from the installed bundle. Commit `311a5b0a552be78f5c58807e2be1db02e3badcb0` is historical Desktop source-audit evidence only, never detected installed metadata.
- Installed backend: `Hermes Agent v0.18.2 (2026.7.7.2)`, live detailed health, authenticated management OpenAPI, and stable management responses.
- Upstream main audit: `0d2ad3993eb91c486854bc71e2721b747ab1d0f4`, fetched 2026-07-19. Installed backend was 328 commits behind at audit time.
- Cabinet: current `feat/hermes-functional-parity` source, management/gateway/run clients, native skills, files, terminal, git, task, session, and approval surfaces.

## Architectural boundaries

Hermes remains canonical for profiles, skills, schedules, memory, sessions, runtime events, and gateway state. Cabinet is a searchable projection and control surface. The Control Center never returns raw keys, tokens, credential values, or secret-bearing gateway URLs. A visible capability is not automatically writable. Consequential mutations continue to require confirmation, reason, owner authorization, and idempotency. Cabinet does not create a duplicate scheduler, skill catalog, memory store, session history, or execution fallback.

## Proof and freshness semantics

Proof kind records how evidence was obtained; proof scope records what it can prove. Only a fresh successful `live_runtime_operation` or an explicit successful `historical_live_acceptance` earns Live-Proven credit. A `source_audit`, `exact_fixture_path`, `cabinet_local_surface`, registry record, failure, or conflict never earns that credit. Exact fixtures prove only the named projection or UI path and remain a non-parity signal.

The projection assembler derives effective freshness from the injected reference time, observation timestamp, proof scope, a bounded future-clock allowance, and a small source-class TTL policy. Caller-asserted freshness is retained for comparison but cannot override timestamp age. Historical evidence stays historical; invalid, missing, or implausibly future observation times become unknown. Generated time is never substituted for observation time.

Gateway reconciliation groups evidence by source and interface, retains the latest valid record per source, and reports a current conflict only when fresh concrete running and stopped sources disagree. Stale, invalid-time, unavailable, and unknown records remain visible as evidence but cannot create a current disagreement.

## Open review items

- Re-audit billing after an approved Hermes upgrade; it is upstream-only for the installed Desktop build.
- Promote diagnostic-only notification, raw configuration, raw log, backup/restore, and gateway diagnostic surfaces only after stable safe projections exist.
- Complete live owner review of the matrix and Control Center before closing this workstream.
