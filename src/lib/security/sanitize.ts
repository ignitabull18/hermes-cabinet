 * HTML sanitization at the render boundary (#66).
 *
 * Every `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the app renders a string that ultimately
 * comes from somewhere untrusted — an agent's output, a note on disk, a
 * registry README fetched over the network, a .ipynb or .xlsx a user opened.
 * All of it lands inside Cabinet's own origin, where the daemon auth token and
 * `/api/daemon/pty` live, so a single `<img src=x onerror=…>` is remote code
 * execution against the user's machine, not a defaced paragraph.
 *
 * Sanitizing HERE rather than inside the markdown pipeline is deliberate:
 * markdown is only one of the producers. Mermaid SVG, LaTeX, syntax
 * highlighting, and SheetJS tables never touch remark, and a pipeline-level
 * fix leaves all of them open.
 *
 * The profiles differ because the payloads differ. Prose needs links and
 * embeds; an SVG needs `<style>` and `<foreignObject>`; highlighted code needs
 * nothing but `<span class>`. Each profile is the smallest allowlist that
 * still renders its producer's real output — see sanitize.test.ts, which pins
 * both halves: attacks die, legitimate markup survives.
 */

// Relative URLs, anchors, and the schemes the app actually links to. `file:`
// is here because `encodeFileUrls` in the markdown pipeline exists to make
// `file:///…` links work — dropping it would silently break a real feature.
// Everything else (notably `javascript:` and bare `data:`) is refused.
//
// The dash in `[^a-z+.\-:]` MUST stay escaped. Unescaped, `.-:` is a character
// RANGE (0x2E–0x3A) that swallows the digits and `/`, and since DOMPurify tests
// EVERY attribute value against this regex — not just URI-ish ones — the result
// is that `d="M10 10 L90 90"` fails validation and every SVG path silently
// loses its geometry. This regex keeps DOMPurify's own tail intact and only
// swaps the scheme list.

// schemes; these are the extras that matter for the markup we do allow.

/**
 * SVG: mermaid diagrams and a notebook's `image/svg+xml` outputs.
 *
 * Both mermaid call sites run with `securityLevel: "loose"`, which means
 * mermaid does NOT sanitize its own output and permits HTML labels — so a
 * diagram authored by an agent is itself an injection vector, and this profile
 * is the only thing standing between that and the DOM. A notebook's SVG output
 * is straight from a file the user opened, i.e. fully untrusted.
 *
 * `html: true` is required alongside the SVG profiles because mermaid emits
 * HTML labels inside `<foreignObject>`. DOMPurify sanitizes across both
 * namespaces and specifically defends the namespace-confusion tricks that make
 * foreignObject interesting to an attacker.
 *
 * `foreignObject` needs BOTH an ADD_TAGS entry and an HTML_INTEGRATION_POINTS
 * entry. DOMPurify refuses HTML children inside an SVG parent unless that
 * parent is a declared integration point, and its default list is just
 * `annotation-xml` — so without the second half, mermaid's labels come back as
 * empty boxes. Opting in does NOT weaken the scrub: HTML inside foreignObject
 * still goes through the full allowlist (verified in sanitize.test.ts — an
 * <img onerror> and a javascript: href planted in a foreignObject both die).
 *
 * KNOWN RESIDUAL RISK: `<style>` is allowed, because stripping it renders every
 * diagram as unstyled spaghetti — and DOMPurify does not sanitize CSS. A
 * hostile diagram can therefore inject global CSS rules. That is a UI-spoofing
 * / clickjacking surface, NOT script execution (browsers do not run
 * `javascript:` inside CSS). Closing it properly means flipping mermaid off
 * `securityLevel: "loose"`, which changes how labels render and is a separate
 * change from this one.
