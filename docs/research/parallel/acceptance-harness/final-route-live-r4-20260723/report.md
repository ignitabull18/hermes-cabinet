# Production acceptance harness

Verdict: **ACCEPTED**

The runner exercised an isolated application build on port 4354. It sent 2 bounded live model message request(s) and did not touch production or canonical data.

## Checks

| supervision | launchd-child-restart | PASSED | The complete isolated supervision recovery suite passed without touching launchd. |
| navigation | history-navigation | PASSED | Back/forward navigation preserved route identity. |
| responsive | mobile-reduced-motion-overflow | PASSED | 390x844 reduced-motion room had 0px horizontal overflow. |

## Recommendation

The isolated integration passed the authoritative acceptance contract.

## Known limitation

Natural-language exact-output requests are not guaranteed byte-for-byte across all configured models. A future constrained-output contract is required for strict machine output.
