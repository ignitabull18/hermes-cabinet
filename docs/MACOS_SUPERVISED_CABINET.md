# Supervised Cabinet on macOS

Cabinet ships a private, loopback-only launchd template at `deploy/macos/ai.cabinet.plist.template`. It starts only the production Next server. It does not own or restart the Cabinet daemon, Hermes, Gateway, Desktop, Tailscale, or any public listener. The current supervised Hermes conversation contract is no-tools only; tool-enabled conversations require a separate governed design.

Build the exact clean runtime worktree first. Render the placeholders into a user LaunchAgent file with owner-only permissions. `CABINET_ENV_FILE` points at the existing owner-only environment file; only that nonsecret path is placed in the plist, never its contents. Cabinet rejects relative paths, symlinks, foreign ownership, and group/world access before startup.

Required substitutions:

- `__SERVICE_LABEL__`: a unique user service label
- `__NODE_PATH__`: the absolute Node executable used for the build
- `__RUNTIME_ROOT__`: the absolute clean runtime worktree
- `__CABINET_DATA_DIR__`: the absolute external Cabinet data directory
- `__CABINET_ENV_FILE__`: the absolute existing owner-only Cabinet environment file
- `__HERMES_EXECUTION_CLI_PATH__`: the approved absolute ACP-capable Hermes CLI
- `__HERMES_PROFILE__`: the exact Hermes profile
- `__CABINET_PORT__`: an unused private port

The owner-only environment file must supply `HERMES_HOME` as an absolute
configuration root and `OLLAMA_API_KEY` as the current server-only provider
credential. The rendered plist supplies the absolute execution CLI, exact
profile, and mandatory no-tools switch. Agent API, Management API, and Gateway
credentials are optional unless their separate Cabinet surfaces are enabled.

Validate the rendered plist with `/usr/bin/plutil -lint`. Load it into the current GUI user domain with `/bin/launchctl bootstrap gui/$(/usr/bin/id -u) <plist>`, inspect with `/bin/launchctl print gui/$(/usr/bin/id -u)/<label>`, and stop it with `/bin/launchctl bootout gui/$(/usr/bin/id -u)/<label>`. `RunAtLoad` starts it after login; `KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false` restarts unexpected failures without relaunching after a clean stop or bootout.

The wrapper is a child-lifecycle boundary, not a second restart supervisor. When Next exits, the wrapper immediately exits with the same code or terminal signal. launchd alone owns restart behavior, and `ThrottleInterval=10` limits restart pressure during a repeated failure. `launchctl bootout` remains the deterministic way to stop the service and cancel restart. `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` are forwarded to Next; if shutdown stalls, the wrapper ends the child after a ten-second grace period so the listener cannot be orphaned.

The template explicitly sets `CABINET_HERMES_EXECUTION_NO_TOOLS=true`. The startup wrapper fails closed before spawning Next unless that value is exactly `true`, runtime mode is `hermes`, the listener is `127.0.0.1`, interventions are disabled, paths are absolute and usable, the data directory exists, and a production standalone build exists. It forces the no-tools value into the child process, so a value in the owner-only environment file cannot weaken the process-level contract. It uses argument-vector process launch and never evaluates a shell command.

The template sends stdout and stderr to `/dev/null`. This deliberately gives the supervised process a zero-growth, nonsecret log sink. Operational diagnosis uses `launchctl print` state and Cabinet's governed diagnostics rather than unbounded raw process output. Do not replace these paths with persistent files unless a bounded, owner-only rotation policy is installed separately.
