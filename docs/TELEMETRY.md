# Cabinet Telemetry

> The public, maintained privacy contract is
> [`../TELEMETRY.md`](../TELEMETRY.md). This file provides implementation
> detail and must stay aligned with that contract.

**To opt out:** set `CABINET_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` in your environment before
launching Cabinet, **or** open *Settings → About → Privacy* and turn off
*Pseudonymous usage telemetry*. Either path disables telemetry completely. No
events are queued and no network requests are made. See [How to turn it
off](#how-to-turn-it-off) below for a third option (editing the config file)
and the exact paths involved.

Cabinet sends pseudonymous usage telemetry by default to help us understand
which features are used and where the product breaks. This implementation
reference mirrors the public contract. If the two files disagree, the
top-level `TELEMETRY.md` contract must be corrected or this implementation must
be brought back into alignment before release.

## What is collected

Every event includes:

- `install_id` — a random UUIDv4 generated once per OS user profile and stored
  in `telemetry.json` (see paths below). Not derived from your hostname, MAC
  address, machine serial, or any other system identifier — it's just a fresh
  random id. Different machines, or different OS user accounts on the same
  machine, get different `install_id`s. Deleting `telemetry.json` produces a
  fresh id on next launch. Not tied to any account or identity.
- `session_id` — a random UUIDv4 minted each time you launch Cabinet (one
  session per run, shared between the daemon and the local web server so all
  events from a single launch share the same id).
- `event_name` — one of the names from the allowlist below. Other names are
  rejected at the server.
- `payload` — small structured fields documented per-event below.
- `client_version` — Cabinet version (e.g. `0.3.4`).
- `platform` — `cli` or `desktop`.
- `os`, `arch`, `node_version` — e.g. `darwin` / `arm64` / `v22.4.0`.
- `occurred_at`, `received_at` — millisecond timestamps.

The server also records, from HTTP metadata:

- The IP address Cloudflare sees for your request, plus country, region, and
  city derived at the edge. This metadata is stored without a Cabinet account,
  user ID, or email in the telemetry schema. See "Where the data goes" below.
- A coarse browser/device hint derived from the User-Agent header when one is
  present.

## What is never collected

- File contents, page titles, page bodies.
- Absolute or relative local paths. Repo or project names.
- Prompts, model responses, or any LLM input or output.
- API keys, tokens, passwords, environment variable values.
- Raw command-line arguments.
- MAC addresses, hostnames, usernames, account IDs, email addresses.
- Any personally identifying information beyond the request IP noted above.

| `onboarding.locale_autodetected` | Onboarding detects a supported system locale | `locale` |
| `onboarding.completed` | Onboarding finishes | `roomType`, `provider` |
| `page.opened` | Reserved — not emitted in this release | `ext` |
| `agent.run.started` | An agent run begins | `provider`, `adapterType` |
| `agent.run.completed` | An agent run finishes successfully | `provider`, `adapterType`, `durationMs`, `success` |
| `agent.run.failed` | An agent run errors or times out | `provider`, `adapterType`, `durationMs`, `errorCode` |
| `task.created` | A task is created (manual / composer / editor trigger) | `source` |
| `task.completed` | A task reaches a terminal state | `durationMs`, `status` |
| `doctor.run` | The doctor / diagnostics command runs | *(none)* |
| `error.unhandled` | The top-level error handler catches something | `where`, `errorCode` |

| `history.tier` | A history tier is selected or observed | `tier` |

The emitter strips any payload key outside the fields listed above for each
event. If a new field is needed, this table is updated in the same commit.

Any new events added to Cabinet are added to this table in the same commit.

## How to turn it off

Three ways, any one is enough:

1. **Environment variable:** `CABINET_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` before starting
   Cabinet. Also sets the Settings toggle to a disabled / read-only state.
2. **Settings toggle:** open Settings → About → Privacy, uncheck
   *Pseudonymous usage telemetry*.
3. **Edit the config file directly:** set `"enabled": false` in
   `telemetry.json` at the path below.

When telemetry is off, no events are enqueued and no network requests are
made to the ingest endpoint.

## Where state lives

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/cabinet-telemetry/telemetry.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\cabinet-telemetry\telemetry.json`
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cabinet/telemetry.json`
  (falls back to `~/.config/cabinet/telemetry.json`)

The same directory contains `telemetry-queue.ndjson`, a short-lived queue of
events waiting to be sent. Delete these files at any time — Cabinet will
generate a fresh `install_id` on next start.

## Where the data goes

- Endpoint: `POST https://reports.runcabinet.com/telemetry`
- Transport: TLS. Rate-limited at the Cloudflare edge.
- Storage: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite on Cloudflare). Access is limited to the
  maintainers.
